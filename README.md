# Discord-Message-Spoofer
spoofs in-app discord messages with winapi writeprocessmemory

To use:
type the message that you want to replace
then add " |" to the message. For example, if the message is "jake paul" then you should put "jake paul |"

Then, type what you want to replace that message with, and add " |" to it, just like the last one.

Then, reload the string by tabbing into another server/dm and tabbing back into the origional one again.
